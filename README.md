Uses Phython, Flask and the MLB Stats API to get the current Red Sox information using HTML and Javascript.

1. Last Red Sox Game Status
2. Current Standings of AL East - the only division that really matters 😁
3. Current Transactions within the past week for the Red Sox
4. Current Red Sox Roster which is sortable clicking on the header

This can be accessed via https://redsox-stats.onrender.com/
